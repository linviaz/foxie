# About Foxie

> Verba Volat, Scripta Manent.

This website is about Learning created by real human. For many times during the problem defining, analysing and solving processes, I was and am worried that I might not find the best solution. Luckily, everytime I did find the solution and mostly they were the best within my vision and capability. I still cannot get rid of the anxiety in finding solutions within the scope of my high standards, but this should not kill the tiny slice of hope which pulls me to continuously make effort.
